OPEN:


For the Quads Indexing System:

get a .xyls file representing all available sloan fields
(entered by Sam, Sept6/05, target Hogg; Hogg is doing this now...)

look at numerical stability of star_coords
(entered by Sam, Sept6/05, target Sam)

figure out why fields that didn't solve didn't solve
(entered by Sam, Sept6/05, target Hogg/Sam)

update IDL code for making USNO catalogue to output .objs format directly
(entered by Sam, Sept9/05, target Sam/Hogg)

make all-sky USNO objs file and make corresponding index
(entered by Sam, Sept9/05, target Sam/Hogg)

solve fields by considering objects in order of brightness 
(entered by Sam, Sept9/05, target Hogg/Sam)

implement a portable fits image to xy-list star finder
(entered by Sam, Sept9/05, target Blanton)


randomize order when reading in objects from catalogue
so that heuristic of making obj_index_A < obj_index_B
and obj_index_C < obj_index_D does not introduce bias
(entered by Sam, Sept8/05, target Sam)

Hogg's idea: once we pick A, pick B randomly, not as furthest from A
(entered by Sam, Sept8/05, target Sam)

finish writing findcode
(entered by Sam, Sept8/05, target Sam)


For the Website:

get a permanent ip for "astrometry" and set up URL cloaking so that
astrometry.net does not appear as a redirect
(entered by Sam, Sept6/05, target Hogg/Blanton/Mulin)

set up a machine for web server and get an account on it for Keir
(entered by Sam, Sept9/05, target Hogg/Blanton/Mulin)

get a list of catalogs for which we want to get complete field
footprint lists
(entered by Sam, Sept6/05, target Hogg/Morad)


RESOLVED:


For the Quads Indexing System:

look at difference between swapping u,v and taking -u for parity flip
(entered by Sam, Sept6/05, target Sam; resolved by sam Sept8/05)


For the Website:




collect stats on:
  what fraction of all possible quads (with iA<iB, iC<iD) are legal
  what fraction of legal quads pass the codetol
  what fraction of codetol quads pass matchtol
  how many quads we have to check before getting a matchtol match

check that second best matchtol is way worse than one we return
