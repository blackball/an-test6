   expected attendance: 
   Dustin, Keir, Morad, David, Mike, Sam (March2/3 only)

2. Current status

   2.1 What have you done?
   2.2 What are you currently working on?
   2.3 What is your principal interest in the project?
   2.4 How far can our current funding take us and how should
       we maximize our chances of getting refunded?

3. Tweak & Solvexy: Going alpha on the WWW

   3.0 What do you imagine the alpha site to be and do?
   3.1 site, WWW pages, front-end
   3.2 managing/controlling cluster
   3.3 Do users upload x,y lists or images?
   3.4 Do we need to avoid IDL?
   3.5 privacy policy
   3.6 data archiving requirements and data model

4. Tweak & Solvexy: Migrating to open source implementations

   4.1 reading usno and using flags
   4.2 object detection
   4.3 cosmic-ray rejection
   4.4 offset from pairs (Hough transform)
   4.5 read and write and use regular astrom headers
   4.6 read and write and use SIP headers
   4.7 least-squares and etc for tweak

5. Other Data Sets and Future Potential Scientific Projects

   5.1 re-solve PMM data to make AN-1.0 (USNO C)
   5.2 cross-identification of sources, including moving soures
       across multiple catalogues/instruments
   5.3 "best possible" heterogeneous-source astrometric catalog
   5.4 structure of the galaxy
   5.5 statistical anomalies on the sky
   5.6 super-resolution multi-wavelength astronomy
   5.7 "social networks" of astronomy: who is looking at what parts
       of the sky that who else is looking at and who is writing what
       papers about what

6. Eventual Extensions of WWW capabilities

   6.1 meta-tweak
   6.2 archiving of input (privacy issues)
   6.3 calibration
   6.4 use of (trusted) archived data
   6.5 other image-processing tasks (satellites, flat-fielding, etc)
