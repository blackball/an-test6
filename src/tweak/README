(These are old instructions; "make" should Just Work.)

Levmar, for nonlinear optimization, must be compiled:
cd ../levmar-2.1.2
./configure
make

So does wcstools
cd ../wcstools-3.6.4/
./configure
make

And cfitsio
cd ../cfitsio/
./configure
make

Then make should work.

To run tweak, use the runtweak script. Runtweak relies on fits2xy for source
extraction, which is in ../simplexy. Build using 

cd ../simplexy
make

The script also relies on some of the fits utilities, like tabsort. Those can
be built in the quads directory and need to be in the path:

cd ../quads
make tabsort
cp tabsort ~/bin
