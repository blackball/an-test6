 - This code is meant as an accompanyment for an upcoming paper and is meant to
   allow reproducing the results of said paper.
 - Research code only (not for reducing data for scientific uses)
 - What is included in this release?
   - A snapshot of all of the components of our current research code,
     including routines to:
     - Convert raw USNO and Tycho2 into FITS format for easier use
     - Uniformize, deduplicate, and cut the FITSified catalogs
     - Build indexes from the cuts for solving
     - Solve fields without any WCS information (blind)
     - A simple HEALPIX implementation
     - QFITS library with several modifications
     - libkd, a compact and high-performance kdtree library
     - avl? bl?
 - Given entire 80gb USNOB raw catalog, the code in the tarball would be
   sufficient to reproduce our indexing system.
   - However, most people don't have raw USNO
   - 1/12th of the sky binary kdtree drop
   - With said system, it is possible to solve SDSS-like fields that overlap
     that particular 1/12th of the sky. 
   - Some example SDSS fields are included 
 - Instructions for the impatient
   - Something similar to go.sh via the web
   - How much disk space is required?
   - What exactly do you need to do to solve a sloan field?
   - What is in out?
   - About printsolved to see what actually got solved
   - input format the file needs to come in
   - how to get tunematch to give a real answer useful for inspection


 - Extended instructions for the interested


SO YOU WANT TO REPRODUCE OUR RESULTS?
-------------------------------------

 * Run go.sh. It will download the source, download a catalog of 1 healpix
   (1/12th of the sky), build an index, download sample SDSS fields, and solve
   them.
