Research Code Snapshot (November 2006) for Astrometry.net
=========================================================
Copyright 2006, David Hogg, Dustin Lang, Keir Mierle and Sam Roweis.

 - This code is meant as an accompanyment for an upcoming paper and its
   main purpose is to allow reproduction of the results in that paper.
 - This is research code only and is not intended for scientific use
   in reducing data or other analyses.
 - This release includes a snapshot of all of the components of our
   current research code, including routines to:
     - Convert raw USNO and Tycho2 into FITS format for easier use
     - Uniformize, deduplicate, and cut the FITSified catalogs
     - A simple but powerful HEALPIX implementation
     - QFITS library with several modifications
     - libkd, a compact and high-performance kdtree library
     - Build the files and data structures our system requires
       (indexes) to build a blind astrometry solver.
 - In principle, the code in the tarball is sufficient to reproduce
   our entire astrometry system and replicate our blind astrometry
   results (e.g. on the SDSS fields). However, this requires the
   entire USNO-B 1.0 catalogue which is about 80GB in size. Therefore,
   as a proof of concept, we have released an intermediate file
   representing the processed catalog data from 1/12th of the sky (including
   converting USNO to fits, uniformizing, cutting by magnitude and
   building a star kd-tree datastructure). 
 - Using this intermediate file, it is possible to build the remainder of
   the index files necessary to blindly solve the
   astrometry for SDSS-like fields that are contained within that
   particular 1/12th of the sky. We have included some example SDSS
   fields in this region which can be used to verify that the system
   has been installed correctly.
 - Quick start instructions:
   1) Go to a directory with 3GB free.
   2) Download and run the file http://astrometry.net/???/getcode.sh
      (it will take about 20mins on a modern workstation).
 - Solving new fields???
   - What exactly do you need to do to solve a sloan field?
   - What is in out?
   - About printsolved to see what actually got solved
   - input format the file needs to come in
     - single field per file, one star per line
     - each line is x y, as read by fscanf("%lf %lf\n")
   - printmatch


SO YOU WANT TO REPRODUCE OUR RESULTS?
-------------------------------------

 * Run go.sh. It will download the source, download a catalog of 1 healpix
   (1/12th of the sky), build an index, download sample SDSS fields, and solve
   them.
