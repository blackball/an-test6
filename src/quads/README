August 2005 (Sam)

This is the ALPHA release of the quad indexing system.

To compile, just cp Makefile_Template to Makefile (linux users
shouldn't need to do any modifications). Then do "make allclean"
followed by "make".

You now have several programs at your disposal, which I'll
very briefly describe below. For a recipe of how to use
these programs to solve a SDSS field using an index built
on a subset of USNO, see the file SLOAN_USNO_README.

The programs all read in certain files and produce new files,
so building a complete index involves running a sequence of commands
which will produce a set of files. At the moment, piping the output
of one command directly into another is not supported.

Some options are common to all programs:
-f index_base_name   specifies the base file name for index files 
                     (.objs,.code,.ckdt,.skdt,.quad,.qidx)
-o field_base_name   specifies the base file name for field files
                     (.xyls,.hits,.xyl0,.ids0,.qds0)
[-a|-b]              specifies ASCII or BINARY format files when possible

Running a program with no arguments produces a list of the
command line arguments it wants. Arguments like this [q] mean that q
is optional, arguments like this { u | v} mean that one of u,v are required.


INDEX BUILDING

startree -- reads a .objs file containing a catalogue of objects
            and writes a .skdt file with a KD-tree on those objects
            built in xyz (3space) coordinates, ignoring magnitude.
getquads -- reads a .skdt KD-tree file and randomly picks points on
            the sky to generate quads at a certain scale
            writes a .quad_ and .code_ file containing the legal quads
            it was able to find and their corresponding codes
quadidx  -- reads a .quad_ and a .code_ file, deduplicates the
            quads (since they were chosen randomly), and builds
            an inverted index to allow reverse lookup from object->quad
            writes a deduplicated .quad and .code files (the old .quad_
            and .code_ files can be removed) and the inverted index .qidx
codetree -- reads a .code file and builds a KD tree in the 4D code space
            writes out a .ckdt KD-tree file

SOLVING 

solvexy  -- the solver itself. reads the .ckdt,.quad and .objs files
            as well as a .xyls file with the field(s) to be solved
            and tries ALL POSSIBLE QUADS in each field against the
            stored quads in the index, looking for matching codes
            (to within some specified tolerance). all matching quads
            are placed on a list and then that list is "resolved"
            by finding 3 or more matches that agree (to within some
            specified agreement accuracy) on pointing, rotation and scale
            writes out a .hits file giving the solve information for
            each field.

(in principle, the .skdt,.code and .qidx files are not needed at solve
 time, and so if you don't want them around for debugging, you can
 delete them after the .ckdt and .quad files are generated)



DIAGNOSTICS

fieldquads -- if you know some (or all) of the catalogue objects
              that are present in a set of fields, you can list these in 
              a .ids0 file (one line per field).
              (if the field was generated synthetically using genfields    
              below, this file is created automatically)
              fieldquads will then tell you, for any given index
              you've built, which quads from the index actually exist
              in the field. note that the order of the object IDS on
              each line is irrelevant, fieldquads only cares about
              which objects are in the field, not how they line up
              with the xy list
findstar -- gets objects from the .objs catalogue file, either by
            ID number or by proximity to a given target point on the sky
findquad -- gets quads/codes from the .quad/.code/.qidx files
            you can either look up a specific quad by number, or find
            all quads involving a specific object ID from the
            catalogue
findcode -- finds all quads having codes near a specified 4D code


TOOLS FOR BUILDING SYNTHETIC CATALOGUES AND FIELDS

randcat   -- makes a .objs catalogue file by filling a portion of the 
             sky with objects uniformly at random
genfields -- generates a synthetic field using a virtual camera and
             a .objs catalogue file. pointing can be either random or
             along a given direction, scale is specified, positions
             of the objects can be "jittered" with noise, and random
             extra "distractor" objects can be added to clutter the field
             currently no support for nonsquare aspect ratios or for
             control over rotation.
             writes out three files:
               a .xyls file containing the field(s)
               a .xyl0 file containing un-jittered objects without distractors
               a .ids0 file containing the catalogue object ID of each star
                            in each field (can be used with fieldquads above)
