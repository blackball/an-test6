How to get the data files required to run the Astrometry.net solver
===================================================================

Preamble
--------
One of the goals of the Astrometry.net project is to "organize, annotate
and make searchable all the world's astronomical information."

We have put a lot of effort into building our solver, and we want to
distribute the source code and the data files that make it tick. Our
project is all about making data accessible, and if we want to become
a central part of astronomical data processing and storage, then our
system must be transparent.  Also, by releasing our source code we hope to
unleash the creative power of our users, who will adapt and extend it to
their own purposes, doing things we haven't even thought about.

We want our code to be open.  However, we want to avoid a situation where
people use our code in ways that don't lead to data becoming more accessible.

Our code is distributed under the GPL, so we cannot impose additional
conditions on its use or distribution.  However, we are also distributing
data files that are required to run the solver, so we are applying
conditions on the distribution of these files.

(DWH: should we mention that it's possible to create your own indices using
the code included in the tarball [except for Barron/Stumm cleaning code] plus
the original USNOB and TYCHO-2 data.)

Conditions
----------
Astrometry.net are making available a set of data files ("indices") under
the following conditions:

1. If the indices are used to provide a web service, then each web page that
makes use of the results must include the following text:
  "This service uses the Astrometry.net solver.  For more details visit
   http://astrometry.net ."

2. If the indices are used to provide a web service, then any astronomical
images solved using the indices must be made available to the Astrometry.net
project, and to any other interested party.  The image files may be made
accessible by providing a list of URLs, or by sending physical media.

3. Redistribution of the indices is not permitted.
