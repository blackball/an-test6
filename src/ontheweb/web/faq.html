<h2>
Welcome Alpha Users
</h2>
We are very excited that you are helping us test our service.<br/>
Below are some answers to commonly asked questions, which we'll try to update
during the alpha testing period.
<hr />

<dl>
<dt>Q: <b>What kinds of images will solve?</b></dt>

<dd>A: We don't know!  That's why you are testing the service.  What
we <i>do</i> know is that we have solved images that range in size
from under 10&nbsp;arcmin to over 80&nbsp;deg.  We also know that we
have solved images taken in bandpasses ranging from the near
ultraviolet to the near infrared.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>I submitted an image and it didn't solve even though it had
an almost exactly correct WCS header to begin.</b> How can you guys
suck so badly that you can't even solve an image when I give you the
right answer?</dt>

<dd>A: Currently, astrometry.net <i>ignores</i> any existing image
meta-data about pointing or rotation.  It only does purely
<i>blind</i> astrometry.  Eventually we plan to perform <q>refinement
only</q> WCS services in addition to the blind service. The current
astrometry.net alpha service may use the input image WCS meta-data, if
it exists, to guess the image scale, but beyond that all meta-data in
the image are ignored.  That is the magic, and principal limitation,
of the service.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>Can I do precision proper-motion analyses with your
output?</b></dt>

<dd>A: Right now we don't do extremely precise, proper-motion-grade
astrometric solutions; these require performing simultaneous analyses
of multiple images from the same instrument and simultaneous analyses
of multiple images of the same part of the sky.  This is on the
long-term to-do list, but it ain't happening during the alpha phase.
If you want precision, multi-image astrometry, we currently recommend
taking the output of astrometry.net and using it as the input for <a
href="http://terapix.iap.fr/rubrique.php?id_rubrique=105">SCAMP</a>.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>Can I use your output to build panoramic or mosaic images
from many individual images?</b></dt>

<dd>A: Yes!  However, see our answer to the previous question: We are
not performing the most precise possible measurements of camera
distortions; if you want awesome mosaics, use Bertin's SCAMP and then
its sister software, SWarp.  Mosaic-quality WCS and automatic
mosaicing of input data are both on our medium-term to-do lists.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>My image didn't solve even though I put in a correct
estimate of the scale and I can see that your source extraction
correctly extracted many USNO-B stars.</b></dt>

<dd>A: Can you phrase that as a question?  We find that the most
common error is to put in the scale as 25 but then accidentally pull
down the tab <q>size of the image in degrees</q> when you meant
<q>size of the image in arcmin</q>.  If you are sure that you have
entered everything correctly and that source extraction is sane, and
it still isn't solving, send email to <q>alpha@astrometry.net</q> with
your jobid, because you clearly have a useful image for
debugging.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>My HST ACS images won't solve!</b> Can't you even solve a
perfectly calibrated and highly recognizable piece of astronomical
data?</dt>

<dd>A: Right now there is a strict limitation that we cannot possibly
solve any image below about 5&nbsp;arcmin on a side.  Don't even
bother trying.  We hope to overcome this eventually, but don't hold
your breath!</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>Why does my submission die silently without returning a
jobid?</b></dt>

<dd>A: Did your job exceed the 250M size limit?  If so, try gzip (yes,
we take gz files).  If not, there is a bug; send email to
<q>alpha@astrometry.net</q>.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>What does the system do with multi-extension FITS
files?</b></dt>

<dd>A: It just looks at the first image-like FITS extension.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>I have tons of images I want to solve.</b> Typing my email
and the size parameters and the image urls into your lame web form
over and over again is driving me crazy. Aren't you guys real
scientists? Can't you give me a high-throughput option?</dt>

<dd>A: In the future there will be a command line client as well as
the option for you to install the entire system locally at your site.
For now, you can speed things up by submitting your first image
manually using the web form and then hitting the LinkToTheseParameters
button. That will construct a url which pre-fills the form. From then
on, all you'll need to change is the url or local filename of the
image. If that's not good enough, the best we can offer you for now is
the following hack, which uses wget (which you could have just copied
from the <q>LinkToTheseParameters</q> link):
<tt>wget&nbsp;&quot;http://live.astrometry.net/index.php?justjobid&amp;email=user@domain.edu&amp;uname=YourName&amp;xysrc=url&amp;imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.astro.domain.edu%2Fuser%2Foutbox%2Fmyfield.jpg&amp;fstype=ev&amp;fse=1&amp;fsv=50&amp;fsunit=degreewidth&amp;fsu=&amp;fsl=&amp;x_col=X&amp;y_col=Y&amp;parity=2&amp;poserr=1&amp;tweak=1&amp;tweak_order=2&amp;index=auto&amp;submit=Submit&quot;&nbsp;-Ojobid_out</tt>
If <i>that's</i> not good enough, alpha tester Phil Marshall (UCSB)
has written a csh script for uploading multiple files you can <a
href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~pjm/astrometry/hansel.csh">grab
here</a>.</dd>

<dt>Q: I looked at the source extraction preview image on the status
page for one of my jobs, and <b>your system totally failed to find
tons of perfectly obvious sources in my image</b>.  What's up?</dt>

<dd>A: We're using a really *dumbass* source extraction algorithm for
now, since it basically has to Just&nbsp;Work&nbsp;(tm) most of the
time.  We'd like to make it more sophisticated, so please send to
<q>alpha@astrometry.net</q> the jobid on which source extraction did
poorly. Also, please remember that you can always do the source
extraction yourself and just send us a list of the X,Y (horizontal and
vertical) positions of the sources within your image. The format is a
simple FITS file which you upload to the web form. If you want an
example of the format, you can download the FITS file of the sources
as we extracted them.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>Is there a way for me to install the system locally on my
own machine?</b></dt>

<dd>A: Not yet. But after we incorporate the feedback, improvements,
and bug-fixes we get during the alpha testing phase (that's you!) we
will release a complete source package and the data files necessary to
reproduce a complete local installation. We use such local
installations for our own science so we totally understand how useful
they can be. Please email us and let us know you are interested and
we'll notify you when the code comes out.</dd>

<dt>Q: Speaking of releasing code, <b>when will you release the
code?</b> I want to look at the source!</dt>

<dd>A: Yeah, right. Sure you do. But seriously, we will be releasing
code, right after the alpha test. Email code@astrometry.net and we'll
put you on the list. If you are super-keen you can browse the source
off of our trac pages: trac.astrometry.net</dd>
