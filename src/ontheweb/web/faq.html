<h2>
Welcome Alpha Users
</h2>
We are very excited that you are helping us test our service.<br/>
Below are some answers to commonly asked questions, which we'll try to update
during the alpha testing period.
<hr />

<dl>
<dt>Q: <b>What kinds of images will solve?</b></dt>

<dd>A: We don't know!  That's why you are testing the service.  What
we <i>do</i> know is that we have solved images that range in size
from under 10&nbsp;arcmin to over 80&nbsp;deg.  We also know that we
have solved images taken in bandpasses ranging from the near
ultraviolet to the near infrared.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>Can I do precision proper-motion analyses with your
output?</b></dt>

<dd>A: Right now we don't do extremely precise, proper-motion-grade
astrometric solutions; these require performing simultaneous analyses
of multiple images from the same instrument and simultaneous analyses
of multiple images of the same part of the sky.  This is on the
long-term to-do list, but it ain't happening during the alpha phase.
If you want precision, multi-image astrometry, we currently recommend
taking the output of astrometry.net and using it as the input for <a
href="http://terapix.iap.fr/rubrique.php?id_rubrique=105">SCAMP</a>.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>I submitted an image and it didn't solve even though it had
an almost exactly correct WCS header.</b> How can you guys suck so
badly that you can't even solve an image when I give you the right
answer?</dt>

<dd>A: Currently, astrometry.net has to "verify" any solution by
ensuring that your field and our all-sky index have a substantial
number of sources in almost exact correspondence under our proposed
alignment solution.  The current astrometry.net will use the WCS
information, if it is there, as an inital guess, but the
"verification" of whether we think we have solved your image proceeds
the same way regardless if we solved you image completely blind or
using WCS as an initial guess.  If your image contains very few
sources which are known to our index, we are not able to verify the
solution at high confidence and so we do not return a match. But
please let us know what jobid failed, and what band your image was in,
so we can improve our index to cover it.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>My image didn't solve even though I put in a correct
estimate of the scale and I can see that your source extraction
correctly extracted many USNO-B stars.</b></dt>

<dd>A: Can you phrase that as a question?  We find that the most
common error is to put in the scale as 25 but then accidentally pull
down the tab "size of the image in degrees" when you meant "size of
the image in arcmin".  If you are sure that you have entered
everything correctly and that source extraction is sane, and it still
isn't solving, send email to "alpha@astrometry.net" with your jobid,
because you clearly have a useful image for debugging.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>Why does my submission die silently without returning a
jobid?</b></dt>

<dd>A: Did your job exceed the 250M size limit?  If so, try gzip (yes,
we take gz files).  If not, there is a bug; send email to
"alpha@astrometry.net".</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>What does the system do with multi-extension files?</b></dt>

<dd>A: It just looks at the first image-like extension.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>I have tons of images I want to solve.</b> Typing my email
and the size parameters and the image urls into your lame web form
over and over again is driving me crazy. Aren't you guys real
scientists? Can't you give me a high-throughput option?</dt>

<dd>A: In the future there will be a command line client as well as
the option for you to install the entire system locally at your site.
For now, you can speed things up by submitting your first image
manually using the web form and then hitting the LinkToTheseParameters
button. That will construct a url which pre-fills the form. From then
on, all you'll need to change is the url or local filename of the
image. If that's still not good enough, the best we can offer you for
now is the following hack, which uses wget.  You need to expose your
image on the web and fill in the info in the first three lines, ie
your email/name, the url to your image and the size info (which you
can just copy from the LinkToTheseParameters link).
<tt>wget&nbsp;&quot;http://live.astrometry.net/index.php?justjobid&amp;email=user@domain.edu&amp;uname=YourName&amp;xysrc=url&amp;imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.astro.domain.edu%2Fuser%2Foutbox%2Fmyfield.jpg&amp;fstype=ev&amp;fse=1&amp;fsv=50&amp;fsunit=degreewidth&amp;fsu=&amp;fsl=&amp;x_col=X&amp;y_col=Y&amp;parity=2&amp;poserr=1&amp;tweak=1&amp;tweak_order=2&amp;index=auto&amp;submit=Submit&quot;&nbsp;-Ojobid_out</tt></dd>

<dt>Q: I looked at the source extraction preview image on the status
page for one of my jobs, and <b>your system totally failed to find
tons of perfectly obvious sources in my image</b>.  What's up?</dt>

<dd>A: We're using a really *dumbass* source extraction algorithm for
now, since it basically has to Just&nbsp;Work&nbsp;(tm) most of the
time.  We'd like to make it more sophisticated, so please send to
"alpha@astrometry.net" the jobid on which source extraction did
poorly.</dd>

<dt>Q: <b>Is there a way for me to install the system locally on my
own machine?</b></dt>

<dd>A: Not yet. But after we incorporate the feedback, improvements,
and bug-fixes we get during the alpha testing phase (that's you!) we
will release a complete source package and the data files necessary to
reproduce a complete local installation. We use such local
installations for our own science so we totally understand how useful
they can be. Please email us and let us know you are interested and
we'll notify you when the code comes out.</dd>

<dt>Q: Speaking of releasing code, <b>when will you release the
code?</b> I want to look at the source!</dt>

<dd>A: Yeah, right. Sure you do. But seriously, we will be releasing
code, right after the alpha test. Email code@astrometry.net and we'll
put you on the list. If you are super-keen you can browse the source
off of our trac pages: trac.astrometry.net</dd>
