<h2>
Welcome Alpha Users
</h2>
We are very excited that you are helping us test our service.<br>
Below are some answers to commonly asked questions, which we'll try to update
during the alpha testing period.
<hr />


<ul>
<li> <b> Q: I submitted an image and it didn't solve although it had an almost exactly correct WCS header.</b><br>
How can you guys suck so badly that you can't even solve an image when I give you the right answer?<br>
A: Currently, astrometry.net has to "verify" any solution by ensuring
that your field and our all-sky index have a substantial number of
sources in almost exact correspondence under our proposed alignment solution.
The current astrometry.net will use the WCS information, if it is
there, as an inital guess, but the "verification" of whether we think
we have solved your image proceeds the same way regardless if we
solved you image completely blind or using WCS as an initial guess.
If your image contains very few sources which are known to our index,
we are not able to verify the solution at high confidence and so we do
not return a match. But please let us know what jobid failed, and what band your image was in, so we can improve our index to cover it.
<p>
<li> <b>Q: I have tons of images I want to solve.</b><br>
Typing my email and the size parameters and the image urls into your lame web form over and
over again is driving me crazy. Aren't you guys real scientists? Can't
you give me a high-throughput option?<br>
A: In the future there will be a command line client as well as the
option for you to install the entire system locally at your site.
For now, you can speed things up by submitting your first image manually using the web form and then hitting
the LinkToTheseParameters button. That will construct a url which
pre-fills the form. From then on, all you'll need to change is the url
or local filename of the image. If that's still not good enough,
the best we can offer you for now is the following hack, which uses wget.
You need to expose your image on the web and fill in the info in the first three lines, ie your
email/name, the url to your image and the size info (which you can
just copy from the LinkToTheseParameters link). We've split the lines to make it more readable but you probably
want it all as one monster line with no breaks.<br>

<li> <b>Q</b>: I looked at the source extraction preview image on the status
page for one of my jobs, and 
<b>your system totally failed to find tons of perfectly obvious sources in my image</b>.
What's up?<br>
A: We're using a really *dumbass* source extraction algorithm for
now, since it basically has to Just Work most of the time.
We'd like to make it more sophisticated, so please send us the jobid
on which source extraction did poorly.
<p>
<li> <b>Q: Is there a way for me to install the system locally on my own machine?</b><br>
A: Not yet. But after we incorporate the feedback/improvements/bug-fixes we get during the alpha testing phase
(that's you!) we will release a complete source package and the data
files necessary to reproduce a complete local installation. We use
such local installations for our own science so we totally understand
how useful they can be. Please email us and let us know you are
interested and we'll notify you when the code comes out.
<p>
<li> <b>Q</b>: Speaking of releasing code, <b>when will you release the code?</b> I
want to look at the source.<br>
A: Yeah, right. Sure you do. But seriously, we will be releasing code,
right after the alpha test. Email code@astrometry.net and we'll put
you on the list. If you are super-keen you can browse the source off
of our trac pages: trac.astrometry.net
