This is a subset of the gsl-1.9 package, containing the files required to provide Cholesky and QR 
decompositions.

We have not modified any of the source files, though we have provided our own Makefile (ignoring
all the automake/autowhatever jazz) that builds just what we need.

Our contributions are Copyright 2007 Dustin Lang and are placed under the GPL.

Yes, that's the royal we.  And we are pleased.
