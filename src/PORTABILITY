Some notes about issues that may be a hassle for those porting our code to other
environments.

-we define _GNU_SOURCE in the Makefile, which yields some GNU-specific extensions

-asprintf(), vasprintf() are GNU extensions.

-basename(): although _GNU_SOURCE defines some different behaviour, we do not depend
  on this.  (solve-field.c)

-canonicalize_file_name(): a GNU extension meant to address problems with realpath().
