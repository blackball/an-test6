Some notes about issues that may be a hassle for those porting our code to other
environments.

The core parts of the code are mostly platform-neutral, but some of the higher-level
pieces are Unix-centric.  For example, we assume that "/" is used to separate path
names, and in some places we use "/bin/sh".  This will make a Windows port unpleasant.
For this we do not apologize. :)

Everything should work fine on big-endian and small-endian machines.  However, the
pre-cooked indices we are distributing will only work on small-endian machines (eg Intel).
If you are interested in running on a big-endian machine, please contact us.

Also, everything should work fine on 64-bit processors, though we have only tested this
with the gcc compiler.  64-bit processors can happily run indices built by 32-bit
processors, and vice versa.


-we define _GNU_SOURCE in the Makefile, which yields some GNU-specific extensions

-asprintf(), vasprintf() are GNU extensions.

-basename(): although _GNU_SOURCE defines some different behaviour, we do not depend
  on this.  (solve-field.c)
