This is a subset of the gsl-1.9 package, containing the files required to provide Cholesky and QR 
decompositions.

=> Updated to gsl-1.11.

We have not modified any of the source files, though we have provided our own Makefile (ignoring
all the automake/autowhatever jazz) that builds just what we need.

Our contributions are Copyright 2007, 2008 Dustin Lang and are placed under the GPL.

Yes, that's the royal we.  And we are pleased.
