We store the database passwords in svn/secure; check out separately with:
  svn co svn+ssh://astrometry.net/svn/secure/django-db secrets

  ln -s settings_test.py settings.py

django is installed on oven in:
/usr/local/django-1.3/lib/python

django-openid-auth is installed on oven in:
/usr/local/django-openid-auth-0.3/lib/python




Adding database users:

as root, psql:

create role USERNAME login;
alter role USERNAME createdb;
grant nova to USERNAME;


I did, initially:
create role nova;
alter role nova createdb;
grant all on database "an-test" to nova;
as nova:
create database "an-supernova";
create database "an-nova";
as root:
grant all on database "an-supernova" to nova;
grant all on database "an-nova" to nova;
