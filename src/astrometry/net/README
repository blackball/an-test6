We store the database passwords in svn/secure; check out separately with:
  svn co svn+ssh://astrometry.net/svn/secure/django-db secrets

Choose which settings to use:
  ln -s settings_test.py settings.py


Add some things to your PYTHONPATH:
  /usr/local/django-1.3/lib/python
  /usr/local/django-openid-auth-0.3/lib/python

Add some things to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH:
  /usr/local/wcslib-4.6.3/lib/pkgconfig

Add some things to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
  /usr/local/wcslib-4.6.3/lib


You will also need to build the Astrometry.net tools:
  (cd ..; make; make extra; make py)





Adding database users:

as root, psql:

create role USERNAME login;
alter role USERNAME createdb;
grant nova to USERNAME;


I did, initially:
create role nova;
alter role nova createdb;
grant all on database "an-test" to nova;
as nova:
create database "an-supernova";
create database "an-nova";
as root:
grant all on database "an-supernova" to nova;
grant all on database "an-nova" to nova;
