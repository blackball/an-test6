This directory contains an Ice setup like this:

-the web service calls cluster24:go/dsolver/astrometry/net/server/ssh-ice-shard.sh
-this creates and cd's to our job dir, extracts the job.axy file, and calls go/dsolver/astrometry/net/ice/IceSolver.py <jobid> <job.axy>, and finally tars up all the files in the dir and sends them back over the pipe.

-IceSolver.py is a client to several SolverServer instances (with different index scales)

-startreg is the registry
-startnode runs on each server node.
