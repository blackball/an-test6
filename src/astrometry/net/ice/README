This directory contains an Ice setup like this:

-the web service calls IceSolver.py, which sends requests to multiple Ice servers.

-starttunnel, run from oven, set up ssh port-forwarding to the glacier2 router running on hydra.
-starttunnel also starts the SessionServer on hydra.
-startreg must be running on hydra.
-servers are listed in write_solver.py
-servers can be launched with startallnodes
-the "daemon" program runs on each hydra neuron to keep icegridnode running
-showendpoints lists active servers.
