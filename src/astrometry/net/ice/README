This directory contains an Ice setup like this:

-the web service calls a thin Ice client which contacts hydra.dgp
-the hydra.dgp server is itself a client to servers on the hydra neurons.

-does hydra have to run two registries?
-the outward-facing one could be registryless.
-startnode runs on each neuron.
