This directory contains an Ice setup like this:

-the web service calls IceSolver.py, which sends requests to multiple Ice servers.


-starttunnel, run from oven:
   -sets up ssh port-forwarding to the glacier2 router running on hydra;
   -starts the glacier2 router
   -starts the registry
   -starts the session server.

-servers are listed in write_solver.py (which creates the solver.xml deployment file)
-servers can be launched with "startallnodes", and stopped with "stopallnodes"
