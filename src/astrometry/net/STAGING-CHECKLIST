-----------------------------------------------
       Preparing a "staging" release.
-----------------------------------------------

(0.) Become nova@oven.

(1.) Tag the code:

cd ~/supernova
svn copy -m "tag" . ^/tags/nova/2011-06-29-1 

(with today's date, and an appropriate release number)

(2.) Stop staging's process_submissions.py:

screen -R staging
# kill running process_submissions -- possible via:
  jobs
  fg 1
  [ctrl-C]
or:
  jobs
  kill %1

# exit the "screen"
  [ctrl-A d]

(3.) Update the staging area and build:

    cd ~/staging
    svn switch ^/tags/nova/2011-06-29-1
    make
    make py
    make extra

(4.) Backup the nova database and data:

    cd ~/staging/net
    ./backup-nova.sh

(5.) Prepare the staging data area.  We use the "unionfs-fuse" union
filesystem for this.  Staging has a read-only view of nova's data,
plus a read-write overlay.  This lets us test out staging with a full
data set without worrying about corrupting nova's data or making the
data and database inconsistent.  (Ditto for the "jobs" directory.)

    cd ~/staging/net
    ./remake-data-dir.sh

(6.) Migrate the nova database and data:

The exact details will depend on whether you have to run any elaborate
schema migration scripts.  In the simplest case, copy the database.

    # stop process_submissions.py on nova temporarily, to allow access to an-nova database
    screen -R nova
    fg 1
    [ctrl-C]
    #exit the 'screen'
    [ctrl-A d]

	# Recreate the an-staging-source database as a duplicate of an-nova as it is.
    # (an-staging-source is used as an intermediary db, so that an-nova and
    # nova's process_submissions.py can be left alone as much as possible)
    dropdb an-staging-source
    createdb -O nova -T an-nova an-staging-source

    # restart process_submissions.py on nova
    screen -R nova
    cd ~/nova/net
    python -u process_submissions.py < /dev/null >> proc.log 2>&1 &
    [ctrl-A d]

    # recreate the an-staging database from an-staging-source
    dropdb an-staging
    createdb -O nova -T an-staging-source an-staging

    # restart process_submissions.py on staging
    screen -R staging
    cd ~/staging/net
    python -u process_submissions.py < /dev/null >> proc.log 2>&1 &
    [ctrl-A d]

python manage.py migrate



(7.) Test it out, email the group when it's ready for review.

(8.) Decide to launch!




THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW STILL NEED TO BE UPDATED (as of 2012-05-31) --dstn

-----------------------------------------------
     So you decided to launch.  Now what?
-----------------------------------------------

(1.) Get dstn to take down the apache2-nova server.

sudo /etc/apache2-nova/stop-apache

(2.) Become nova@oven .

(3.) Update the code and build.

cd ~/nova
svn switch ^/tags/nova/2011-06-29-1
make
make py
make extra

(4.) Stop nova's process_submissions.py (as described above)
     Stop staging's process_submissions.py

(5.) Migrate the database and data (as above)

Simplest case:

dropdb an-staging-source
createdb -O nova -T an-staging an-staging-source
dropdb an-nova
createdb -O nova -T an-staging-source an-nova
mv data data-tmp
mv jobs jobs-tmp
mv ~/staging/net/data .
mv ~/staging/net/jobs .

(6.) Restart nova's process_submissions.py (as described above)
     Restart staging's process_submissions.py

(7.) Get dstn to bring up the apache2-nova server again.

sudo /etc/apache2-nova/start-apache
