This directory contains an Ice setup like this:

-the web service calls ssh_master.py, which talks to
-hydra:dsolver/astrometry/net/server/ice-shard-hydra.sh
-this creates and cd's to our job dir, extracts the job.axy file, and calls:
   -dsolver/astrometry/net/ice/IceSolver.py <jobid> <job.axy>
-ice-shard-hydra.sh, finally, tars up all the files in the dir and sends them back over the pipe.

-IceSolver.py is a client to several SolverServer instances (with different index scales)

-startreg  runs on hydra, on the 10.x.x.x network
-startnode runs on each server node.
